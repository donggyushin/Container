# Container

A Swift Package for A modern approach to Service Locator for Swift and SwiftUI.

## About

Container is inspired by the excellent [Factory](https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory) library, but designed as a lightweight alternative. This library focuses on simplicity while providing essential dependency injection features with automatic memory management through weak references, even when using shared scope.

1. Go to File â†’ Add Package Dependencies
